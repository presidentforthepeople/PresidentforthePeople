    <h2>My Platform</h2>
    <p>This campaign is about real solutions for real people. I’m not for sale — I’m here to work for you.</p>

    <ul class="platform-list">
      <li><strong>1. Fix the Homeless Epidemic:</strong> Expand federal housing, mental health services, and job programs to support unhoused Americans.</li>
      <li><strong>2. Free Healthcare for All:</strong> Create a universal, publicly funded healthcare system that covers everyone equally.</li>
      <li><strong>3. Tax the Rich:</strong> End corporate loopholes and make billionaires and megacorporations pay their fair share.</li>
      <li><strong>4. Increase SNAP Funding:</strong> Ensure every American has access to food by boosting and modernizing the food stamp program.</li>
      <li><strong>5. No Lobbyist Control:</strong> I will take donations, but never sell out to lobbyists or billionaires. This campaign stays accountable to the people.</li>
      <li><strong>6. Crack Down on Drug Sellers:</strong> Target large-scale traffickers, not users, while expanding harm reduction and addiction treatment.</li>
      <li><strong>7. Rebuild the Department of Education:</strong> Fully restore and fund the Department to prioritize public schools and educational access.</li>
      <li><strong>8. Lower the National Debt:</strong> Curb reckless spending and focus on fair taxation, closing loopholes, and ending unnecessary subsidies to the wealthy.</li>
      <li><strong>9. Reinstate Roe v. Wade:</strong> Codify the right to abortion and ensure reproductive freedom for all Americans.</li>
      <li><strong>10. Full LGBTQIA+ Protections:</strong> Guarantee civil rights protections for all LGBTQIA+ people, including federal anti-discrimination laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each of these issues will be expanded with detailed proposals in the weeks to come.</p>
